      <description>&lt;p&gt;Accept only external authenticators that are NIST-compliant; and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Document and maintain a list of accepted external authenticators.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Acceptance of only NIST-compliant external authenticators applies to organizational systems that are accessible to the public (e.g., public-facing websites). External authenticators are issued by nonfederal government entities and are compliant with &lt;a href=&#34;#e59c5a7c-8b1f-49ca-8de0-6ee0882180ce&#34;&gt;SP 800-63B&lt;/a&gt; . Approved external authenticators meet or exceed the minimum Federal Government-wide technical, security, privacy, and organizational maturity requirements. Meeting or exceeding Federal requirements allows Federal Government relying parties to trust external authenticators in connection with an authentication transaction at a specified authenticator assurance level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Establish configuration requirements, connection requirements, and implementation guidance for organization-controlled mobile devices, to include when such devices are outside of controlled areas; and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Authorize the connection of mobile devices to organizational systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it can easily be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection; possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained power source. Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook/desktop systems, depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. Protection and control of mobile devices is behavior or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting information and systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Control physical access to [Assignment: organization-defined system distribution and transmission lines requiring physical access controls are defined;] within organizational facilities using [Assignment: organization-defined security controls to be implemented to control physical access to system distribution and transmission lines within the organizational facility are defined;].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Security controls applied to system distribution and transmission lines prevent accidental damage, disruption, and physical tampering. Such controls may also be necessary to prevent eavesdropping or modification of unencrypted transmissions. Security controls used to control physical access to system distribution and transmission lines include disconnected or locked spare jacks, locked wiring closets, protection of cabling by conduit or cable trays, and wiretapping sensors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Enforce approved authorizations for logical access to information and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Access control policies control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users or processes acting on behalf of users) and passive entities or objects (i.e., devices, files, records, domains) in organizational systems. In addition to enforcing authorized access at the system level and recognizing that systems can host many applications and services in support of mission and business functions, access enforcement mechanisms can also be employed at the application and service level to provide increased information security and privacy. In contrast to logical access controls that are implemented within the system, physical access controls are addressed by the controls in the Physical and Environmental Protection ( &lt;a href=&#34;#pe&#34;&gt;PE&lt;/a&gt; ) family.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Limit the number of external network connections to the system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Limiting the number of external network connections facilitates monitoring of inbound and outbound communications traffic. The Trusted Internet Connection &lt;a href=&#34;#4f42ee6e-86cc-403b-a51f-76c2b4f81b54&#34;&gt;DHS TIC&lt;/a&gt; initiative is an example of a federal guideline that requires limits on the number of external network connections. Limiting the number of external network connections to the system is important during transition periods from older to newer technologies (e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 network protocols). Such transitions may require implementing the older and newer technologies simultaneously during the transition period and thus increase the number of access points to the system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Define, document, approve, and enforce physical and logical access restrictions associated with changes to the system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Changes to the hardware, software, or firmware components of systems or the operational procedures related to the system can potentially have significant effects on the security of the systems or individuals’ privacy. Therefore, organizations permit only qualified and authorized individuals to access systems for purposes of initiating changes. Access restrictions include physical and logical access controls (see &lt;a href=&#34;../ac-3/&#34;&gt;AC-3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;../pe-3/&#34;&gt;PE-3&lt;/a&gt; ), software libraries, workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (i.e., changes implemented into external interfaces rather than directly into systems), and change windows (i.e., changes occur only during specified times).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Implement replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for access to [privileged accounts; non-privileged accounts].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Authentication processes resist replay attacks if it is impractical to achieve successful authentications by replaying previous authentication messages. Replay-resistant techniques include protocols that use nonces or challenges such as time synchronous or cryptographic authenticators.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for access to [privileged accounts; non-privileged accounts] are implemented.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Identification and authentication policy&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;system security plan&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;procedures addressing user identification and authentication&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/moderate/ia-2.6/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Implement multi-factor authentication for [local, network and remote] access to [privileged accounts; non-privileged accounts] such that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the factors is provided by a device separate from the system gaining access; and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The device meets [FIPS-validated or NSA-approved cryptography].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PIV=separate device. Please refer to NIST SP 800-157 Guidelines for Derived Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Credentials.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See SC-13 Guidance for more information on FIPS-validated or NSA-approved cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of requiring a device that is separate from the system to which the user is attempting to gain access for one of the factors during multi-factor authentication is to reduce the likelihood of compromising authenticators or credentials stored on the system. Adversaries may be able to compromise such authenticators or credentials and subsequently impersonate authorized users. Implementing one of the factors on a separate device (e.g., a hardware token), provides a greater strength of mechanism and an increased level of assurance in the authentication process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Monitor system accounts for [Assignment: organization-defined atypical usage for which to monitor system accounts is defined;] ; and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Report atypical usage of system accounts to [at a minimum, the ISSO and/or similar role within the organization].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Required for privileged accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Required for privileged accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Atypical usage includes accessing systems at certain times of the day or from locations that are not consistent with the normal usage patterns of individuals. Monitoring for atypical usage may reveal rogue behavior by individuals or an attack in progress. Account monitoring may inadvertently create privacy risks since data collected to identify atypical usage may reveal previously unknown information about the behavior of individuals. Organizations assess and document privacy risks from monitoring accounts for atypical usage in their privacy impact assessment and make determinations that are in alignment with their privacy program plan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Employ the following acquisition strategies, contract tools, and procurement methods to protect against, identify, and mitigate supply chain risks: [Assignment: organization-defined acquisition strategies, contract tools, and procurement methods to protect against, identify, and mitigate supply chain risks are defined;].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The use of the acquisition process provides an important vehicle to protect the supply chain. There are many useful tools and techniques available, including obscuring the end use of a system or system component, using blind or filtered buys, requiring tamper-evident packaging, or using trusted or controlled distribution. The results from a supply chain risk assessment can guide and inform the strategies, tools, and methods that are most applicable to the situation. Tools and techniques may provide protections against unauthorized production, theft, tampering, insertion of counterfeits, insertion of malicious software or backdoors, and poor development practices throughout the system development life cycle. Organizations also consider providing incentives for suppliers who implement controls, promote transparency into their processes and security and privacy practices, provide contract language that addresses the prohibition of tainted or counterfeit components, and restrict purchases from untrustworthy suppliers. Organizations consider providing training, education, and awareness programs for personnel regarding supply chain risk, available mitigation strategies, and when the programs should be employed. Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans, documentation, and evidence are commensurate with the security and privacy requirements of the organization. Contracts may specify documentation protection requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Confirmation can take the form of a temporary enrollment code or a notice of proofing. The delivery address for these artifacts is obtained from records and not self-asserted by the user. The address can include a physical or digital address. A home address is an example of a physical address. Email addresses and telephone numbers are examples of digital addresses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Establish an alternate storage site, including necessary agreements to permit the storage and retrieval of system backup information; and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ensure that the alternate storage site provides controls equivalent to that of the primary site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alternate storage sites are geographically distinct from primary storage sites and maintain duplicate copies of information and data if the primary storage site is not available. Similarly, alternate processing sites provide processing capability if the primary processing site is not available. Geographically distributed architectures that support contingency requirements may be considered alternate storage sites. Items covered by alternate storage site agreements include environmental conditions at the alternate sites, access rules for systems and facilities, physical and environmental protection requirements, and coordination of delivery and retrieval of backup media. Alternate storage sites reflect the requirements in contingency plans so that organizations can maintain essential mission and business functions despite compromise, failure, or disruption in organizational systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

While distinct from alternative processing sites, alternate work sites can provide readily available alternate locations during contingency operations. Organizations can define different sets of controls for specific alternate work sites or types of sites depending on the work-related activities conducted at the sites. Implementing and assessing the effectiveness of organization-defined controls and providing a means to communicate incidents at alternate work sites supports the contingency planning activities of organizations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ensure the systems that collectively provide name/address resolution service for an organization are fault-tolerant and implement internal and external role separation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Systems that provide name and address resolution services include domain name system (DNS) servers. To eliminate single points of failure in systems and enhance redundancy, organizations employ at least two authoritative domain name system servers—one configured as the primary server and the other configured as the secondary server. Additionally, organizations typically deploy the servers in two geographically separated network subnetworks (i.e., not located in the same physical facility). For role separation, DNS servers with internal roles only process name and address resolution requests from within organizations (i.e., from internal clients). DNS servers with external roles only process name and address resolution information requests from clients external to organizations (i.e., on external networks, including the Internet). Organizations specify clients that can access authoritative DNS servers in certain roles (e.g., by address ranges and explicit lists).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Provide and implement an audit record reduction and report generation capability that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Supports on-demand audit record review, analysis, and reporting requirements and after-the-fact investigations of incidents; and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does not alter the original content or time ordering of audit records.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Audit record reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit log information and organizes it into a summary format that is more meaningful to analysts. Audit record reduction and report generation capabilities do not always emanate from the same system or from the same organizational entities that conduct audit logging activities. The audit record reduction capability includes modern data mining techniques with advanced data filters to identify anomalous behavior in audit records. The report generation capability provided by the system can generate customizable reports. Time ordering of audit records can be an issue if the granularity of the timestamp in the record is insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For some types of systems, such as desktops or notebooks with relatively large monitors, the threat (referred to as shoulder surfing) may be significant. For other types of systems, such as mobile devices with small displays, the threat may be less significant and is balanced against the increased likelihood of typographic input errors due to small keyboards. Thus, the means for obscuring authentication feedback is selected accordingly. Obscuring authentication feedback includes displaying asterisks when users type passwords into input devices or displaying feedback for a very limited time before obscuring it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

To facilitate a comprehensive authorized software process and increase the strength of protection for attacks that bypass application level authorized software, software programs may be decomposed into and monitored at different levels of detail. These levels include applications, application programming interfaces, application modules, scripts, system processes, system services, kernel functions, registries, drivers, and dynamic link libraries. The concept of permitting the execution of authorized software may also be applied to user actions, system ports and protocols, IP addresses/ranges, websites, and MAC addresses. Organizations consider verifying the integrity of authorized software programs using digital signatures, cryptographic checksums, or hash functions. Verification of authorized software can occur either prior to execution or at system startup. The identification of authorized URLs for websites is addressed in &lt;a href=&#34;../ca-3.5/&#34;&gt;CA-3(5)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;../sc-7/&#34;&gt;SC-7&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Employ automated tools and mechanisms to support near real-time analysis of events.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Automated tools and mechanisms include host-based, network-based, transport-based, or storage-based event monitoring tools and mechanisms or security information and event management (SIEM) technologies that provide real-time analysis of alerts and notifications generated by organizational systems. Automated monitoring techniques can create unintended privacy risks because automated controls may connect to external or otherwise unrelated systems. The matching of records between these systems may create linkages with unintended consequences. Organizations assess and document these risks in their privacy impact assessment and make determinations that are in alignment with their privacy program plan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Detect the presence of unauthorized hardware, software, and firmware components within the system using [automated mechanisms with a maximum five-minute delay in detection] [continuously] ; and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Take the following actions when unauthorized components are detected: [Selection: disable network access by unauthorized components, isolate unauthorized components, notify [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles to be notified when unauthorized components are detected is/are defined (if selected);] ].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Automated unauthorized component detection is applied in addition to the monitoring for unauthorized remote connections and mobile devices. Monitoring for unauthorized system components may be accomplished on an ongoing basis or by the periodic scanning of systems for that purpose. Automated mechanisms may also be used to prevent the connection of unauthorized components (see &lt;a href=&#34;../cm-7.9/&#34;&gt;CM-7(9)&lt;/a&gt; ). Automated mechanisms can be implemented in systems or in separate system components. When acquiring and implementing automated mechanisms, organizations consider whether such mechanisms depend on the ability of the system component to support an agent or supplicant in order to be detected since some types of components do not have or cannot support agents (e.g., IoT devices, sensors). Isolation can be achieved , for example, by placing unauthorized system components in separate domains or subnets or quarantining such components. This type of component isolation is commonly referred to as &amp;ldquo;sandboxing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Select a control baseline for the system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Select the appropriate FedRAMP Baseline&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Control baselines are predefined sets of controls specifically assembled to address the protection needs of a group, organization, or community of interest. Controls are chosen for baselines to either satisfy mandates imposed by laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines or address threats common to all users of the baseline under the assumptions specific to the baseline. Baselines represent a starting point for the protection of individuals’ privacy, information, and information systems with subsequent tailoring actions to manage risk in accordance with mission, business, or other constraints (see &lt;a href=&#34;../pl-11/&#34;&gt;PL-11&lt;/a&gt; ). Federal control baselines are provided in &lt;a href=&#34;#46d9e201-840e-440e-987c-2c773333c752&#34;&gt;SP 800-53B&lt;/a&gt; . The selection of a control baseline is determined by the needs of stakeholders. Stakeholder needs consider mission and business requirements as well as mandates imposed by applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. For example, the control baselines in &lt;a href=&#34;#46d9e201-840e-440e-987c-2c773333c752&#34;&gt;SP 800-53B&lt;/a&gt; are based on the requirements from &lt;a href=&#34;#0c67b2a9-bede-43d2-b86d-5f35b8be36e9&#34;&gt;FISMA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455&#34;&gt;PRIVACT&lt;/a&gt; . The requirements, along with the NIST standards and guidelines implementing the legislation, direct organizations to select one of the control baselines after the reviewing the information types and the information that is processed, stored, and transmitted on the system; analyzing the potential adverse impact of the loss or compromise of the information or system on the organization’s operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation; and considering the results from system and organizational risk assessments. &lt;a href=&#34;#4e4fbc93-333d-45e6-a875-de36b878b6b9&#34;&gt;CNSSI 1253&lt;/a&gt; provides guidance on control baselines for national security systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tailor the selected control baseline by applying specified tailoring actions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The concept of tailoring allows organizations to specialize or customize a set of baseline controls by applying a defined set of tailoring actions. Tailoring actions facilitate such specialization and customization by allowing organizations to develop security and privacy plans that reflect their specific mission and business functions, the environments where their systems operate, the threats and vulnerabilities that can affect their systems, and any other conditions or situations that can impact their mission or business success. Tailoring guidance is provided in &lt;a href=&#34;#46d9e201-840e-440e-987c-2c773333c752&#34;&gt;SP 800-53B&lt;/a&gt; . Tailoring a control baseline is accomplished by identifying and designating common controls, applying scoping considerations, selecting compensating controls, assigning values to control parameters, supplementing the control baseline with additional controls as needed, and providing information for control implementation. The general tailoring actions in &lt;a href=&#34;#46d9e201-840e-440e-987c-2c773333c752&#34;&gt;SP 800-53B&lt;/a&gt; can be supplemented with additional actions based on the needs of organizations. Tailoring actions can be applied to the baselines in &lt;a href=&#34;#46d9e201-840e-440e-987c-2c773333c752&#34;&gt;SP 800-53B&lt;/a&gt; in accordance with the security and privacy requirements from &lt;a href=&#34;#0c67b2a9-bede-43d2-b86d-5f35b8be36e9&#34;&gt;FISMA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455&#34;&gt;PRIVACT&lt;/a&gt; , and &lt;a href=&#34;#27847491-5ce1-4f6a-a1e4-9e483782f0ef&#34;&gt;OMB A-130&lt;/a&gt; . Alternatively, other communities of interest adopting different control baselines can apply the tailoring actions in &lt;a href=&#34;#46d9e201-840e-440e-987c-2c773333c752&#34;&gt;SP 800-53B&lt;/a&gt; to specialize or customize the controls that represent the specific needs and concerns of those entities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Conversely, the depth of vulnerability scanning coverage can be expressed as the level of the system design that the organization intends to monitor (e.g., component, module, subsystem, element). Organizations can determine the sufficiency of vulnerability scanning coverage with regard to its risk tolerance and other factors. Scanning tools and how the tools are configured may affect the depth and coverage. Multiple scanning tools may be needed to achieve the desired depth and coverage. &lt;a href=&#34;#a21aef46-7330-48a0-b2e1-c5bb8b2dd11d&#34;&gt;SP 800-53A&lt;/a&gt; provides additional information on the breadth and depth of coverage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Event outcomes include indicators of event success or failure and event-specific results, such as the system security and privacy posture after the event occurred. Organizations consider how audit records can reveal information about individuals that may give rise to privacy risks and how best to mitigate such risks. For example, there is the potential to reveal personally identifiable information in the audit trail, especially if the trail records inputs or is based on patterns or time of usage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Correlate information from monitoring tools and mechanisms employed throughout the system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Correlating information from different system monitoring tools and mechanisms can provide a more comprehensive view of system activity. Correlating system monitoring tools and mechanisms that typically work in isolation—including malicious code protection software, host monitoring, and network monitoring—can provide an organization-wide monitoring view and may reveal otherwise unseen attack patterns. Understanding the capabilities and limitations of diverse monitoring tools and mechanisms and how to maximize the use of information generated by those tools and mechanisms can help organizations develop, operate, and maintain effective monitoring programs. The correlation of monitoring information is especially important during the transition from older to newer technologies (e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 network protocols).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For example, criticality analysis is a key tenet of supply chain risk management and informs the prioritization of protection activities. The identification of critical system components and functions considers applicable laws, executive orders, regulations, directives, policies, standards, system functionality requirements, system and component interfaces, and system and component dependencies. Systems engineers conduct a functional decomposition of a system to identify mission-critical functions and components. The functional decomposition includes the identification of organizational missions supported by the system, decomposition into the specific functions to perform those missions, and traceability to the hardware, software, and firmware components that implement those functions, including when the functions are shared by many components within and external to the system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Developer input is essential to organizational criticality analysis because organizations may not have access to detailed design documentation for system components that are developed as commercial off-the-shelf products. Such design documentation includes functional specifications, high-level designs, low-level designs, source code, and hardware schematics. Criticality analysis is important for organizational systems that are designated as high value assets. High value assets can be moderate- or high-impact systems due to heightened adversarial interest or potential adverse effects on the federal enterprise. Developer input is especially important when organizations conduct supply chain criticality analyses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[Protect against] the effects of the following types of denial-of-service events: [at a minimum: ICMP (ping) flood, SYN flood, slowloris, buffer overflow attack, and volume attack] ; and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Employ the following controls to achieve the denial-of-service objective: [Assignment: organization-defined controls to achieve the denial-of-service objective by type of denial-of-service event are defined;].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Denial-of-service events may occur due to a variety of internal and external causes, such as an attack by an adversary or a lack of planning to support organizational needs with respect to capacity and bandwidth. Such attacks can occur across a wide range of network protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6). A variety of technologies are available to limit or eliminate the origination and effects of denial-of-service events. For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain types of packets to protect system components on internal networks from being directly affected by or the source of denial-of-service attacks. Employing increased network capacity and bandwidth combined with service redundancy also reduces the susceptibility to denial-of-service events.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Organization-defined device types include devices that are not owned by the organization. Systems use shared known information (e.g., Media Access Control [MAC], Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol [TCP/IP] addresses) for device identification or organizational authentication solutions (e.g., Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol [EAP], RADIUS server with EAP-Transport Layer Security [TLS] authentication, Kerberos) to identify and authenticate devices on local and wide area networks. Organizations determine the required strength of authentication mechanisms based on the security categories of systems and mission or business requirements. Because of the challenges of implementing device authentication on a large scale, organizations can restrict the application of the control to a limited number/type of devices based on mission or business needs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Device locks can be implemented at the operating system level or at the application level. A proximity lock may be used to initiate the device lock (e.g., via a Bluetooth-enabled device or dongle). User-initiated device locking is behavior or policy-based and, as such, requires users to take physical action to initiate the device lock. Device locks are not an acceptable substitute for logging out of systems, such as when organizations require users to log out at the end of workdays.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A UPS is typically used to protect computers, data centers, telecommunication equipment, or other electrical equipment where an unexpected power disruption could cause injuries, fatalities, serious mission or business disruption, or loss of data or information. A UPS differs from an emergency power system or backup generator in that the UPS provides near-instantaneous protection from unanticipated power interruptions from the main power source by providing energy stored in batteries, supercapacitors, or flywheels. The battery duration of a UPS is relatively short but provides sufficient time to start a standby power source, such as a backup generator, or properly shut down the system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Identify, report, and correct system flaws;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Test software and firmware updates related to flaw remediation for effectiveness and potential side effects before installation;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Install security-relevant software and firmware updates within [within thirty (30) days of release of updates] of the release of the updates; and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Incorporate flaw remediation into the organizational configuration management process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The need to remediate system flaws applies to all types of software and firmware. Organizations identify systems affected by software flaws, including potential vulnerabilities resulting from those flaws, and report this information to designated organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities. Security-relevant updates include patches, service packs, and malicious code signatures. Organizations also address flaws discovered during assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system error handling. By incorporating flaw remediation into configuration management processes, required remediation actions can be tracked and verified.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to identify the functions, ports, protocols, and services intended for organizational use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services early in the system development life cycle (e.g., during the initial requirements definition and design stages) allows organizations to influence the design of the system, system component, or system service. This early involvement in the system development life cycle helps organizations avoid or minimize the use of functions, ports, protocols, or services that pose unnecessarily high risks and understand the trade-offs involved in blocking specific ports, protocols, or services or requiring system service providers to do so. Early identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services avoids costly retrofitting of controls after the system, component, or system service has been implemented. &lt;a href=&#34;../sa-9/&#34;&gt;SA-9&lt;/a&gt; describes the requirements for external system services. Organizations identify which functions, ports, protocols, and services are provided from external sources.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The management of individual identifiers is not applicable to shared system accounts. Typically, individual identifiers are the usernames of the system accounts assigned to those individuals. In such instances, the account management activities of &lt;a href=&#34;../ac-2/&#34;&gt;AC-2&lt;/a&gt; use account names provided by &lt;a href=&#34;../ia-4/&#34;&gt;IA-4&lt;/a&gt; . Identifier management also addresses individual identifiers not necessarily associated with system accounts. Preventing the reuse of identifiers implies preventing the assignment of previously used individual, group, role, service, or device identifiers to different individuals, groups, roles, services, or devices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Identify critical system assets supporting [Selection: all, essential] mission and business functions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Organizations may choose to identify critical assets as part of criticality analysis, business continuity planning, or business impact analyses. Organizations identify critical system assets so that additional controls can be employed (beyond the controls routinely implemented) to help ensure that organizational mission and business functions can continue to be conducted during contingency operations. The identification of critical information assets also facilitates the prioritization of organizational resources. Critical system assets include technical and operational aspects. Technical aspects include system components, information technology services, information technology products, and mechanisms. Operational aspects include procedures (i.e., manually executed operations) and personnel (i.e., individuals operating technical controls and/or executing manual procedures). Organizational program protection plans can assist in identifying critical assets. If critical assets are resident within or supported by external service providers, organizations consider implementing &lt;a href=&#34;../cp-2.7/&#34;&gt;CP-2(7)&lt;/a&gt; as a control enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Employ independent assessors or assessment teams to monitor the controls in the system on an ongoing basis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Organizations maximize the value of control assessments by requiring that assessments be conducted by assessors with appropriate levels of independence. The level of required independence is based on organizational continuous monitoring strategies. Assessor independence provides a degree of impartiality to the monitoring process. To achieve such impartiality, assessors do not create a mutual or conflicting interest with the organizations where the assessments are being conducted, assess their own work, act as management or employees of the organizations they are serving, or place themselves in advocacy positions for the organizations acquiring their services.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system and between connected systems based on [Assignment: organization-defined information flow control policies within the system and between connected systems are defined;].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Information flow control regulates where information can travel within a system and between systems (in contrast to who is allowed to access the information) and without regard to subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions include blocking external traffic that claims to be from within the organization, keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, restricting web requests that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring information between organizations may require an agreement specifying how the information flow is enforced (see &lt;a href=&#34;../ca-3/&#34;&gt;CA-3&lt;/a&gt; ). Transferring information between systems in different security or privacy domains with different security or privacy policies introduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security or privacy policies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between connected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions to enforce specific security and privacy policies. Enforcement includes prohibiting information transfers between connected systems (i.e., allowing access only), verifying write permissions before accepting information from another security or privacy domain or connected system, employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows, and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security or privacy attributes and labels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prevent unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Preventing unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources stops information produced by the actions of prior users or roles (or the actions of processes acting on behalf of prior users or roles) from being available to current users or roles (or current processes acting on behalf of current users or roles) that obtain access to shared system resources after those resources have been released back to the system. Information in shared system resources also applies to encrypted representations of information. In other contexts, control of information in shared system resources is referred to as object reuse and residual information protection. Information in shared system resources does not address information remanence, which refers to the residual representation of data that has been nominally deleted; covert channels (including storage and timing channels), where shared system resources are manipulated to violate information flow restrictions; or components within systems for which there are only single users or roles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Check the validity of the following information inputs: [Assignment: organization-defined information inputs to the system requiring validity checks are defined;].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Validate all information inputs and document any exceptions&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Checking the valid syntax and semantics of system inputs—including character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values—verifies that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. For example, if the organization specifies that numerical values between 1-100 are the only acceptable inputs for a field in a given application, inputs of &amp;ldquo;387,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;abc,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;%K%&amp;rdquo; are invalid inputs and are not accepted as input to the system. Valid inputs are likely to vary from field to field within a software application. Applications typically follow well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives the corrupted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to passing them to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation ensures accurate and correct inputs and prevents attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The principle of least privilege is also applied to system processes, ensuring that the processes have access to systems and operate at privilege levels no higher than necessary to accomplish organizational missions or business functions. Organizations consider the creation of additional processes, roles, and accounts as necessary to achieve least privilege. Organizations apply least privilege to the development, implementation, and operation of organizational systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Using such assessments and reusing existing assessment evidence can decrease the time and resources required for assessments by limiting the independent assessment activities that organizations need to perform. The factors that organizations consider in determining whether to accept assessment results from external organizations can vary. Such factors include the organization’s past experience with the organization that conducted the assessment, the reputation of the assessment organization, the level of detail of supporting assessment evidence provided, and mandates imposed by applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Accredited testing laboratories that support the Common Criteria Program &lt;a href=&#34;#6afc1b04-c9d6-4023-adbc-f8fbe33a3c73&#34;&gt;ISO 15408-1&lt;/a&gt; , the NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP), or the NIST Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP) can provide independent assessment results that organizations can leverage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Technical competence of supervising individuals relates to the maintenance performed on the systems, while having required access authorizations refers to maintenance on and near the systems. Individuals not previously identified as authorized maintenance personnel—such as information technology manufacturers, vendors, systems integrators, and consultants—may require privileged access to organizational systems, such as when they are required to conduct maintenance activities with little or no notice.

Organizations have flexibility in determining roles for the approval of maintenance tools and how that approval is documented. A periodic review of maintenance tools facilitates the withdrawal of approval for outdated, unsupported, irrelevant, or no-longer-used tools. Maintenance tools can include hardware, software, and firmware items and may be pre-installed, brought in with maintenance personnel on media, cloud-based, or downloaded from a website. Such tools can be vehicles for transporting malicious code, either intentionally or unintentionally, into a facility and subsequently into systems. Maintenance tools can include hardware and software diagnostic test equipment and packet sniffers. The hardware and software components that support maintenance and are a part of the system (including the software implementing utilities such as &amp;ldquo;ping,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;ls,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;ipconfig,&amp;rdquo; or the hardware and software implementing the monitoring port of an Ethernet switch) are not addressed by maintenance tools.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Digital media includes diskettes, magnetic tapes, external or removable hard disk drives (e.g., solid state, magnetic), flash drives, compact discs, and digital versatile discs. Non-digital media includes paper and microfilm. Controlled unclassified information is defined by the National Archives and Records Administration along with the appropriate safeguarding and dissemination requirements for such information and is codified in &lt;a href=&#34;#91f992fb-f668-4c91-a50f-0f05b95ccee3&#34;&gt;32 CFR 2002&lt;/a&gt; . Security markings are generally not required for media that contains information determined by organizations to be in the public domain or to be publicly releasable.

Examples include digital media in scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, workstations, network components, mobile devices, and non-digital media (e.g., paper and microfilm). The sanitization process removes information from system media such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques—including clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, de-identification of personally identifiable information, and destruction—prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals when such media is reused or released for disposal. Organizations determine the appropriate sanitization methods, recognizing that destruction is sometimes necessary when other methods cannot be applied to media requiring sanitization. Organizations use discretion on the employment of approved sanitization techniques and procedures for media that contains information deemed to be in the public domain or publicly releasable or information deemed to have no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if released for reuse or disposal. Sanitization of non-digital media includes destruction, removing a classified appendix from an otherwise unclassified document, or redacting selected sections or words from a document by obscuring the redacted sections or words in a manner equivalent in effectiveness to removing them from the document. NSA standards and policies control the sanitization process for media that contains classified information. NARA policies control the sanitization process for controlled unclassified information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Digital media includes flash drives, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external or removable hard disk drives (e.g., solid state, magnetic), compact discs, and digital versatile discs. Non-digital media includes paper and microfilm. Physically controlling stored media includes conducting inventories, ensuring procedures are in place to allow individuals to check out and return media to the library, and maintaining accountability for stored media. Secure storage includes a locked drawer, desk, or cabinet or a controlled media library. The type of media storage is commensurate with the security category or classification of the information on the media. Controlled areas are spaces that provide physical and procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting information and systems. Fewer controls may be needed for media that contains information determined to be in the public domain, publicly releasable, or have limited adverse impacts on organizations, operations, or individuals if accessed by other than authorized personnel. In these situations, physical access controls provide adequate protection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Reviewing physical access logs can help identify suspicious activity, anomalous events, or potential threats. The reviews can be supported by audit logging controls, such as &lt;a href=&#34;../au-2/&#34;&gt;AU-2&lt;/a&gt; , if the access logs are part of an automated system. Organizational incident response capabilities include investigations of physical security incidents and responses to the incidents. Incidents include security violations or suspicious physical access activities. Suspicious physical access activities include accesses outside of normal work hours, repeated accesses to areas not normally accessed, accesses for unusual lengths of time, and out-of-sequence accesses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The authentication factors are defined as follows: something you know (e.g., a personal identification number [PIN]), something you have (e.g., a physical authenticator such as a cryptographic private key), or something you are (e.g., a biometric). Multi-factor authentication solutions that feature physical authenticators include hardware authenticators that provide time-based or challenge-response outputs and smart cards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card or the DoD Common Access Card. In addition to authenticating users at the system level, organizations may also employ authentication mechanisms at the application level, at their discretion, to provide increased information security. Regardless of the type of access (i.e., local, network, remote), non-privileged accounts are authenticated using multi-factor options appropriate for the level of risk. Organizations can provide additional security measures, such as additional or more rigorous authentication mechanisms, for specific types of access.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Terminating network connections associated with specific communications sessions includes de-allocating TCP/IP address or port pairs at the operating system level and de-allocating the networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. Periods of inactivity may be established by organizations and include time periods by type of network access or for specific network accesses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ensure that unencrypted static authenticators are not embedded in applications or other forms of static storage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this context, prohibited static storage refers to any storage where unencrypted authenticators, such as passwords, persist beyond the time required to complete the access process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to applications, other forms of static storage include access scripts and function keys. Organizations exercise caution when determining whether embedded or stored authenticators are in encrypted or unencrypted form. If authenticators are used in the manner stored, then those representations are considered unencrypted authenticators.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Require that users of system accounts (or roles) with access to [all security functions] use non-privileged accounts or roles, when accessing nonsecurity functions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Examples of security functions include but are not limited to: establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters, system programming, system and security administration, other privileged functions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Requiring the use of non-privileged accounts when accessing nonsecurity functions limits exposure when operating from within privileged accounts or roles. The inclusion of roles addresses situations where organizations implement access control policies, such as role-based access control, and where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for the user and the processes acting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between a privileged and non-privileged account.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Local maintenance and diagnostic activities are carried out by individuals who are physically present at the system location and not communicating across a network connection. Authentication techniques used to establish nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions reflect the network access requirements in &lt;a href=&#34;../ia-2/&#34;&gt;IA-2&lt;/a&gt; . Strong authentication requires authenticators that are resistant to replay attacks and employ multi-factor authentication. Strong authenticators include PKI where certificates are stored on a token protected by a password, passphrase, or biometric. Enforcing requirements in &lt;a href=&#34;../ma-4/&#34;&gt;MA-4&lt;/a&gt; is accomplished, in part, by other controls. &lt;a href=&#34;#e59c5a7c-8b1f-49ca-8de0-6ee0882180ce&#34;&gt;SP 800-63B&lt;/a&gt; provides additional guidance on strong authentication and authenticators.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Penetration testing goes beyond automated vulnerability scanning and is conducted by agents and teams with demonstrable skills and experience that include technical expertise in network, operating system, and/or application level security. Penetration testing can be used to validate vulnerabilities or determine the degree of penetration resistance of systems to adversaries within specified constraints. Such constraints include time, resources, and skills. Penetration testing attempts to duplicate the actions of adversaries and provides a more in-depth analysis of security- and privacy-related weaknesses or deficiencies. Penetration testing is especially important when organizations are transitioning from older technologies to newer technologies (e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 network protocols).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Such reviews are especially important during transition periods from older technologies to newer technologies (e.g., transition from IPv4 to IPv6). These technology transitions may require implementing the older and newer technologies simultaneously during the transition period and returning to minimum essential functions, ports, protocols, and services at the earliest opportunity. Organizations can either decide the relative security of the function, port, protocol, and/or service or base the security decision on the assessment of other entities. Unsecure protocols include Bluetooth, FTP, and peer-to-peer networking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Organizations may allow a limited number of user actions without identification or authentication, including when individuals access public websites or other publicly accessible federal systems, when individuals use mobile phones to receive calls, or when facsimiles are received. Organizations identify actions that normally require identification or authentication but may, under certain circumstances, allow identification or authentication mechanisms to be bypassed. Such bypasses may occur, for example, via a software-readable physical switch that commands bypass of the logon functionality and is protected from accidental or unmonitored use. Permitting actions without identification or authentication does not apply to situations where identification and authentication have already occurred and are not repeated but rather to situations where identification and authentication have not yet occurred. Organizations may decide that there are no user actions that can be performed on organizational systems without identification and authentication, and therefore, the value for the assignment operation can be &amp;ldquo;none.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Proper position designation is the foundation of an effective and consistent suitability and personnel security program. The Position Designation System (PDS) assesses the duties and responsibilities of a position to determine the degree of potential damage to the efficiency or integrity of the service due to misconduct of an incumbent of a position and establishes the risk level of that position. The PDS assessment also determines if the duties and responsibilities of the position present the potential for position incumbents to bring about a material adverse effect on national security and the degree of that potential effect, which establishes the sensitivity level of a position. The results of the assessment determine what level of investigation is conducted for a position. Risk designations can guide and inform the types of authorizations that individuals receive when accessing organizational information and information systems. Position screening criteria include explicit information security role appointment requirements. Parts 1400 and 731 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, establish the requirements for organizations to evaluate relevant covered positions for a position sensitivity and position risk designation commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of those positions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) is a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) program that directs telecommunications service providers (e.g., wireline and wireless phone companies) to give preferential treatment to users enrolled in the program when they need to add new lines or have their lines restored following a disruption of service, regardless of the cause. The FCC sets the rules and policies for the TSP program, and the Department of Homeland Security manages the TSP program. The TSP program is always in effect and not contingent on a major disaster or attack taking place. Federal sponsorship is required to enroll in the TSP program.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maintain a separate execution domain for each executing system process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Systems can maintain separate execution domains for each executing process by assigning each process a separate address space. Each system process has a distinct address space so that communication between processes is performed in a manner controlled through the security functions, and one process cannot modify the executing code of another process. Maintaining separate execution domains for executing processes can be achieved, for example, by implementing separate address spaces. Process isolation technologies, including sandboxing or virtualization, logically separate software and firmware from other software, firmware, and data. Process isolation helps limit the access of potentially untrusted software to other system resources. The capability to maintain separate execution domains is available in commercial operating systems that employ multi-state processor technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The impact occurs when external providers control the location of processing, storage, or services. The criteria that external providers use for the selection of processing, storage, or service locations may be different from the criteria that organizations use. For example, organizations may desire that data or information storage locations be restricted to certain locations to help facilitate incident response activities in case of information security incidents or breaches. Incident response activities, including forensic analyses and after-the-fact investigations, may be adversely affected by the governing laws, policies, or protocols in the locations where processing and storage occur and/or the locations from which system services emanate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Red team exercises simulate attempts by adversaries to compromise mission and business functions and provide a comprehensive assessment of the security and privacy posture of systems and organizations. Such attempts may include technology-based attacks and social engineering-based attacks. Technology-based attacks include interactions with hardware, software, or firmware components and/or mission and business processes. Social engineering-based attacks include interactions via email, telephone, shoulder surfing, or personal conversations. Red team exercises are most effective when conducted by penetration testing agents and teams with knowledge of and experience with current adversarial tactics, techniques, procedures, and tools. While penetration testing may be primarily laboratory-based testing, organizations can use red team exercises to provide more comprehensive assessments that reflect real-world conditions. The results from red team exercises can be used by organizations to improve security and privacy awareness and training and to assess control effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Types of remote access include dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations use encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity for remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs provides sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such connections as internal networks if the cryptographic mechanisms used are implemented in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does not enhance the availability of remote connections. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can also affect the ability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote access controls apply to systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public access. Authorization of each remote access type addresses authorization prior to allowing remote access without specifying the specific formats for such authorization. While organizations may use information exchange and system connection security agreements to manage remote access connections to other systems, such agreements are addressed as part of &lt;a href=&#34;../ca-3/&#34;&gt;CA-3&lt;/a&gt; .

Organizations may choose to define additional actions for audit logging process failures based on the type of failure, the location of the failure, the severity of the failure, or a combination of such factors. When the audit logging process failure is related to storage, the response is carried out for the audit log storage repository (i.e., the distinct system component where the audit logs are stored), the system on which the audit logs reside, the total audit log storage capacity of the organization (i.e., all audit log storage repositories combined), or all three.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Respond to findings from security and privacy assessments, monitoring, and audits in accordance with organizational risk tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Organizations have many options for responding to risk including mitigating risk by implementing new controls or strengthening existing controls, accepting risk with appropriate justification or rationale, sharing or transferring risk, or avoiding risk. The risk tolerance of the organization influences risk response decisions and actions. Risk response addresses the need to determine an appropriate response to risk before generating a plan of action and milestones entry. For example, the response may be to accept risk or reject risk, or it may be possible to mitigate the risk immediately so that a plan of action and milestones entry is not needed. However, if the risk response is to mitigate the risk, and the mitigation cannot be completed immediately, a plan of action and milestones entry is generated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A proxy server is a server (i.e., system or application) that acts as an intermediary for clients requesting system resources from non-organizational or other organizational servers. System resources that may be requested include files, connections, web pages, or services. Client requests established through a connection to a proxy server are assessed to manage complexity and provide additional protection by limiting direct connectivity. Web content filtering devices are one of the most common proxy servers that provide access to the Internet. Proxy servers can support the logging of Transmission Control Protocol sessions and the blocking of specific Uniform Resource Locators, Internet Protocol addresses, and domain names. Web proxies can be configured with organization-defined lists of authorized and unauthorized websites. Note that proxy servers may inhibit the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) and create the potential for &amp;ldquo;man-in-the-middle&amp;rdquo; attacks (depending on the implementation).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Separation of duties includes dividing mission or business functions and support functions among different individuals or roles, conducting system support functions with different individuals, and ensuring that security personnel who administer access control functions do not also administer audit functions. Because separation of duty violations can span systems and application domains, organizations consider the entirety of systems and system components when developing policy on separation of duties. Separation of duties is enforced through the account management activities in &lt;a href=&#34;../ac-2/&#34;&gt;AC-2&lt;/a&gt; , access control mechanisms in &lt;a href=&#34;../ac-3/&#34;&gt;AC-3&lt;/a&gt; , and identity management activities in &lt;a href=&#34;../ia-2/&#34;&gt;IA-2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;../ia-4/&#34;&gt;IA-4&lt;/a&gt; , and &lt;a href=&#34;../ia-12/&#34;&gt;IA-12&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Separate user functionality, including user interface services, from system management functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;System management functionality includes functions that are necessary to administer databases, network components, workstations, or servers. These functions typically require privileged user access. The separation of user functions from system management functions is physical or logical. Organizations may separate system management functions from user functions by using different computers, instances of operating systems, central processing units, or network addresses; by employing virtualization techniques; or some combination of these or other methods. Separation of system management functions from user functions includes web administrative interfaces that employ separate authentication methods for users of any other system resources. Separation of system and user functions may include isolating administrative interfaces on different domains and with additional access controls. The separation of system and user functionality can be achieved by applying the systems security engineering design principles in &lt;a href=&#34;../sa-8/&#34;&gt;SA-8&lt;/a&gt; , including &lt;a href=&#34;../sa-8.1/&#34;&gt;SA-8(1)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;../sa-8.3/&#34;&gt;SA-8(3)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;../sa-8.4/&#34;&gt;SA-8(4)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;../sa-8.10/&#34;&gt;SA-8(10)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;../sa-8.12/&#34;&gt;SA-8(12)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;../sa-8.13/&#34;&gt;SA-8(13)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;../sa-8.14/&#34;&gt;SA-8(14)&lt;/a&gt; , and &lt;a href=&#34;../sa-8.18/&#34;&gt;SA-8(18)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Automatically terminate a user session after [Assignment: organization-defined conditions or trigger events requiring session disconnect are defined;].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Session termination addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions (in contrast to &lt;a href=&#34;../sc-10/&#34;&gt;SC-10&lt;/a&gt; , which addresses the termination of network connections associated with communications sessions (i.e., network disconnect)). A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational system. Such user sessions can be terminated without terminating network sessions. Session termination ends all processes associated with a user’s logical session except for those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated. Conditions or trigger events that require automatic termination of the session include organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, or time-of-day restrictions on system use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prevent split tunneling for remote devices connecting to organizational systems unless the split tunnel is securely provisioned using [Assignment: organization-defined safeguards to securely provision split tunneling are defined;].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Split tunneling is the process of allowing a remote user or device to establish a non-remote connection with a system and simultaneously communicate via some other connection to a resource in an external network. This method of network access enables a user to access remote devices and simultaneously, access uncontrolled networks. Split tunneling might be desirable by remote users to communicate with local system resources, such as printers or file servers. However, split tunneling can facilitate unauthorized external connections, making the system vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration of organizational information. Split tunneling can be prevented by disabling configuration settings that allow such capability in remote devices and by preventing those configuration settings from being configurable by users. Prevention can also be achieved by the detection of split tunneling (or of configuration settings that allow split tunneling) in the remote device, and by prohibiting the connection if the remote device is using split tunneling. A virtual private network (VPN) can be used to securely provision a split tunnel. A securely provisioned VPN includes locking connectivity to exclusive, managed, and named environments, or to a specific set of pre-approved addresses, without user control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

CSOs must ensure that vendors are compliant with physical facility access and logical access controls to supplied products.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An assessment and review of supplier risk includes security and supply chain risk management processes, foreign ownership, control or influence (FOCI), and the ability of the supplier to effectively assess subordinate second-tier and third-tier suppliers and contractors. The reviews may be conducted by the organization or by an independent third party. The reviews consider documented processes, documented controls, all-source intelligence, and publicly available information related to the supplier or contractor. Organizations can use open-source information to monitor for indications of stolen information, poor development and quality control practices, information spillage, or counterfeits. In some cases, it may be appropriate or required to share assessment and review results with other organizations in accordance with any applicable rules, policies, or inter-organizational agreements or contracts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The security engineering principles in &lt;a href=&#34;../sa-8/&#34;&gt;SA-8&lt;/a&gt; help individuals properly design, code, and test systems and system components. Organizations include qualified personnel (e.g., senior agency information security officers, senior agency officials for privacy, security and privacy architects, and security and privacy engineers) in system development life cycle processes to ensure that established security and privacy requirements are incorporated into organizational systems. Role-based security and privacy training programs can ensure that individuals with key security and privacy roles and responsibilities have the experience, skills, and expertise to conduct assigned system development life cycle activities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Synchronize system clocks within and between systems and system components.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Time synchronization of system clocks is essential for the correct execution of many system services, including identification and authentication processes that involve certificates and time-of-day restrictions as part of access control. Denial of service or failure to deny expired credentials may result without properly synchronized clocks within and between systems and system components. Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. The granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between system clocks and reference clocks, such as clocks synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or tens of milliseconds. Organizations may define different time granularities for system components. Time service can be critical to other security capabilities—such as access control and identification and authentication—depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support the capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Reliability pertains to the systems and system components where the backup information is stored, the operations used to retrieve the information, and the integrity of the information being retrieved. Independent and specialized tests can be used for each of the aspects of reliability. For example, decrypting and transporting (or transmitting) a random sample of backup files from the alternate storage or backup site and comparing the information to the same information at the primary processing site can provide such assurance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Use internal system clocks to generate time stamps for audit records; and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Record time stamps for audit records that meet [one second granularity of time measurement] and that use Coordinated Universal Time, have a fixed local time offset from Coordinated Universal Time, or that include the local time offset as part of the time stamp.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Time stamps generated by the system include date and time. Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. Granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between system clocks and reference clocks (e.g., clocks synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or tens of milliseconds). Organizations may define different time granularities for different system components. Time service can be critical to other security capabilities such as access control and identification and authentication, depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support those capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
