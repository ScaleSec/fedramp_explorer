      <description>&lt;p&gt;Accept only external authenticators that are NIST-compliant; and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Document and maintain a list of accepted external authenticators.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Acceptance of only NIST-compliant external authenticators applies to organizational systems that are accessible to the public (e.g., public-facing websites). External authenticators are issued by nonfederal government entities and are compliant with &lt;a href=&#34;#e59c5a7c-8b1f-49ca-8de0-6ee0882180ce&#34;&gt;SP 800-63B&lt;/a&gt; . Approved external authenticators meet or exceed the minimum Federal Government-wide technical, security, privacy, and organizational maturity requirements. Meeting or exceeding Federal requirements allows Federal Government relying parties to trust external authenticators in connection with an authentication transaction at a specified authenticator assurance level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/li-saas/ac-19/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Establish configuration requirements, connection requirements, and implementation guidance for organization-controlled mobile devices, to include when such devices are outside of controlled areas; and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Authorize the connection of mobile devices to organizational systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it can easily be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection; possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained power source. Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook/desktop systems, depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. Protection and control of mobile devices is behavior or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting information and systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Enforce approved authorizations for logical access to information and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Access control policies control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users or processes acting on behalf of users) and passive entities or objects (i.e., devices, files, records, domains) in organizational systems. In addition to enforcing authorized access at the system level and recognizing that systems can host many applications and services in support of mission and business functions, access enforcement mechanisms can also be employed at the application and service level to provide increased information security and privacy. In contrast to logical access controls that are implemented within the system, physical access controls are addressed by the controls in the Physical and Environmental Protection ( &lt;a href=&#34;#pe&#34;&gt;PE&lt;/a&gt; ) family.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Define, document, approve, and enforce physical and logical access restrictions associated with changes to the system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Changes to the hardware, software, or firmware components of systems or the operational procedures related to the system can potentially have significant effects on the security of the systems or individuals’ privacy. Therefore, organizations permit only qualified and authorized individuals to access systems for purposes of initiating changes. Access restrictions include physical and logical access controls (see &lt;a href=&#34;../ac-3/&#34;&gt;AC-3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;../pe-3/&#34;&gt;PE-3&lt;/a&gt; ), software libraries, workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (i.e., changes implemented into external interfaces rather than directly into systems), and change windows (i.e., changes occur only during specified times).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Employ the following acquisition strategies, contract tools, and procurement methods to protect against, identify, and mitigate supply chain risks: [Assignment: organization-defined acquisition strategies, contract tools, and procurement methods to protect against, identify, and mitigate supply chain risks are defined;].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The use of the acquisition process provides an important vehicle to protect the supply chain. There are many useful tools and techniques available, including obscuring the end use of a system or system component, using blind or filtered buys, requiring tamper-evident packaging, or using trusted or controlled distribution. The results from a supply chain risk assessment can guide and inform the strategies, tools, and methods that are most applicable to the situation. Tools and techniques may provide protections against unauthorized production, theft, tampering, insertion of counterfeits, insertion of malicious software or backdoors, and poor development practices throughout the system development life cycle. Organizations also consider providing incentives for suppliers who implement controls, promote transparency into their processes and security and privacy practices, provide contract language that addresses the prohibition of tainted or counterfeit components, and restrict purchases from untrustworthy suppliers. Organizations consider providing training, education, and awareness programs for personnel regarding supply chain risk, available mitigation strategies, and when the programs should be employed. Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans, documentation, and evidence are commensurate with the security and privacy requirements of the organization. Contracts may specify documentation protection requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/li-saas/sc-22/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ensure the systems that collectively provide name/address resolution service for an organization are fault-tolerant and implement internal and external role separation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Systems that provide name and address resolution services include domain name system (DNS) servers. To eliminate single points of failure in systems and enhance redundancy, organizations employ at least two authoritative domain name system servers—one configured as the primary server and the other configured as the secondary server. Additionally, organizations typically deploy the servers in two geographically separated network subnetworks (i.e., not located in the same physical facility). For role separation, DNS servers with internal roles only process name and address resolution requests from within organizations (i.e., from internal clients). DNS servers with external roles only process name and address resolution information requests from clients external to organizations (i.e., on external networks, including the Internet). Organizations specify clients that can access authoritative DNS servers in certain roles (e.g., by address ranges and explicit lists).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This includes the retention and availability of audit records relative to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, subpoenas, and law enforcement actions. Organizations develop standard categories of audit records relative to such types of actions and standard response processes for each type of action. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) General Records Schedules provide federal policy on records retention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Obscure feedback of authentication information during the authentication process to protect the information from possible exploitation and use by unauthorized individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Authentication feedback from systems does not provide information that would allow unauthorized individuals to compromise authentication mechanisms. For some types of systems, such as desktops or notebooks with relatively large monitors, the threat (referred to as shoulder surfing) may be significant. For other types of systems, such as mobile devices with small displays, the threat may be less significant and is balanced against the increased likelihood of typographic input errors due to small keyboards. Thus, the means for obscuring authentication feedback is selected accordingly. Obscuring authentication feedback includes displaying asterisks when users type passwords into input devices or displaying feedback for a very limited time before obscuring it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Baseline configurations are documented, formally reviewed, and agreed-upon specifications for systems or configuration items within those systems. Baseline configurations serve as a basis for future builds, releases, or changes to systems and include security and privacy control implementations, operational procedures, information about system components, network topology, and logical placement of components in the system architecture. Maintaining baseline configurations requires creating new baselines as organizational systems change over time. Baseline configurations of systems reflect the current enterprise architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Select a control baseline for the system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Control baselines are predefined sets of controls specifically assembled to address the protection needs of a group, organization, or community of interest. Controls are chosen for baselines to either satisfy mandates imposed by laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines or address threats common to all users of the baseline under the assumptions specific to the baseline. Baselines represent a starting point for the protection of individuals’ privacy, information, and information systems with subsequent tailoring actions to manage risk in accordance with mission, business, or other constraints (see &lt;a href=&#34;../pl-11/&#34;&gt;PL-11&lt;/a&gt; ). Federal control baselines are provided in &lt;a href=&#34;#46d9e201-840e-440e-987c-2c773333c752&#34;&gt;SP 800-53B&lt;/a&gt; . The selection of a control baseline is determined by the needs of stakeholders. Stakeholder needs consider mission and business requirements as well as mandates imposed by applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. For example, the control baselines in &lt;a href=&#34;#46d9e201-840e-440e-987c-2c773333c752&#34;&gt;SP 800-53B&lt;/a&gt; are based on the requirements from &lt;a href=&#34;#0c67b2a9-bede-43d2-b86d-5f35b8be36e9&#34;&gt;FISMA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455&#34;&gt;PRIVACT&lt;/a&gt; . The requirements, along with the NIST standards and guidelines implementing the legislation, direct organizations to select one of the control baselines after the reviewing the information types and the information that is processed, stored, and transmitted on the system; analyzing the potential adverse impact of the loss or compromise of the information or system on the organization’s operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation; and considering the results from system and organizational risk assessments. &lt;a href=&#34;#4e4fbc93-333d-45e6-a875-de36b878b6b9&#34;&gt;CNSSI 1253&lt;/a&gt; provides guidance on control baselines for national security systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tailor the selected control baseline by applying specified tailoring actions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The concept of tailoring allows organizations to specialize or customize a set of baseline controls by applying a defined set of tailoring actions. Tailoring actions facilitate such specialization and customization by allowing organizations to develop security and privacy plans that reflect their specific mission and business functions, the environments where their systems operate, the threats and vulnerabilities that can affect their systems, and any other conditions or situations that can impact their mission or business success. Tailoring guidance is provided in &lt;a href=&#34;#46d9e201-840e-440e-987c-2c773333c752&#34;&gt;SP 800-53B&lt;/a&gt; . Tailoring a control baseline is accomplished by identifying and designating common controls, applying scoping considerations, selecting compensating controls, assigning values to control parameters, supplementing the control baseline with additional controls as needed, and providing information for control implementation. The general tailoring actions in &lt;a href=&#34;#46d9e201-840e-440e-987c-2c773333c752&#34;&gt;SP 800-53B&lt;/a&gt; can be supplemented with additional actions based on the needs of organizations. Tailoring actions can be applied to the baselines in &lt;a href=&#34;#46d9e201-840e-440e-987c-2c773333c752&#34;&gt;SP 800-53B&lt;/a&gt; in accordance with the security and privacy requirements from &lt;a href=&#34;#0c67b2a9-bede-43d2-b86d-5f35b8be36e9&#34;&gt;FISMA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455&#34;&gt;PRIVACT&lt;/a&gt; , and &lt;a href=&#34;#27847491-5ce1-4f6a-a1e4-9e483782f0ef&#34;&gt;OMB A-130&lt;/a&gt; . Alternatively, other communities of interest adopting different control baselines can apply the tailoring actions in &lt;a href=&#34;#46d9e201-840e-440e-987c-2c773333c752&#34;&gt;SP 800-53B&lt;/a&gt; to specialize or customize the controls that represent the specific needs and concerns of those entities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Subnetworks that are physically or logically separated from internal networks are referred to as demilitarized zones or DMZs. Restricting or prohibiting interfaces within organizational systems includes restricting external web traffic to designated web servers within managed interfaces, prohibiting external traffic that appears to be spoofing internal addresses, and prohibiting internal traffic that appears to be spoofing external addresses. &lt;a href=&#34;#f5edfe51-d1f2-422e-9b27-5d0e90b49c72&#34;&gt;SP 800-189&lt;/a&gt; provides additional information on source address validation techniques to prevent ingress and egress of traffic with spoofed addresses. Commercial telecommunications services are provided by network components and consolidated management systems shared by customers. These services may also include third party-provided access lines and other service elements. Such services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security provisions. Boundary protection may be implemented as a common control for all or part of an organizational network such that the boundary to be protected is greater than a system-specific boundary (i.e., an authorization boundary).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For example, disposal can occur during research and development, design, prototyping, or operations/maintenance and include methods such as disk cleaning, removal of cryptographic keys, partial reuse of components. Opportunities for compromise during disposal affect physical and logical data, including system documentation in paper-based or digital files; shipping and delivery documentation; memory sticks with software code; or complete routers or servers that include permanent media, which contain sensitive or proprietary information. Additionally, proper disposal of system components helps to prevent such components from entering the gray market.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Event outcomes include indicators of event success or failure and event-specific results, such as the system security and privacy posture after the event occurred. Organizations consider how audit records can reveal information about individuals that may give rise to privacy risks and how best to mitigate such risks. For example, there is the potential to reveal personally identifiable information in the audit trail, especially if the trail records inputs or is based on patterns or time of usage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For example, some individuals may only need to know when and where to report for duty during contingency operations and if normal duties are affected; system administrators may require additional training on how to establish systems at alternate processing and storage sites; and organizational officials may receive more specific training on how to conduct mission-essential functions in designated off-site locations and how to establish communications with other governmental entities for purposes of coordination on contingency-related activities. Training for contingency roles or responsibilities reflects the specific continuity requirements in the contingency plan. Events that may precipitate an update to contingency training content include, but are not limited to, contingency plan testing or an actual contingency (lessons learned), assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. At the discretion of the organization, participation in a contingency plan test or exercise, including lessons learned sessions subsequent to the test or exercise, may satisfy contingency plan training requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Such attacks can occur across a wide range of network protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6). A variety of technologies are available to limit or eliminate the origination and effects of denial-of-service events. For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain types of packets to protect system components on internal networks from being directly affected by or the source of denial-of-service attacks. Employing increased network capacity and bandwidth combined with service redundancy also reduces the susceptibility to denial-of-service events.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Organizations identify systems affected by software flaws, including potential vulnerabilities resulting from those flaws, and report this information to designated organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities. Security-relevant updates include patches, service packs, and malicious code signatures. Organizations also address flaws discovered during assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system error handling. By incorporating flaw remediation into configuration management processes, required remediation actions can be tracked and verified.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Uniquely identify and authenticate non-organizational users or processes acting on behalf of non-organizational users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Non-organizational users include system users other than organizational users explicitly covered by &lt;a href=&#34;../ia-2/&#34;&gt;IA-2&lt;/a&gt; . Non-organizational users are uniquely identified and authenticated for accesses other than those explicitly identified and documented in &lt;a href=&#34;../ac-14/&#34;&gt;AC-14&lt;/a&gt; . Identification and authentication of non-organizational users accessing federal systems may be required to protect federal, proprietary, or privacy-related information (with exceptions noted for national security systems). Organizations consider many factors—including security, privacy, scalability, and practicality—when balancing the need to ensure ease of use for access to federal information and systems with the need to protect and adequately mitigate risk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Uniquely identify and authenticate organizational users and associate that unique identification with processes acting on behalf of those users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Organizations can satisfy the identification and authentication requirements by complying with the requirements in &lt;a href=&#34;#f16e438e-7114-4144-bfe2-2dfcad8cb2d0&#34;&gt;HSPD 12&lt;/a&gt; . Organizational users include employees or individuals who organizations consider to have an equivalent status to employees (e.g., contractors and guest researchers). Unique identification and authentication of users applies to all accesses other than those that are explicitly identified in &lt;a href=&#34;../ac-14/&#34;&gt;AC-14&lt;/a&gt; and that occur through the authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Since processes execute on behalf of groups and roles, organizations may require unique identification of individuals in group accounts or for detailed accountability of individual activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Manage system identifiers by:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Receiving authorization from [at a minimum, the ISSO (or similar role within the organization)] to assign an individual, group, role, service, or device identifier;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Selecting an identifier that identifies an individual, group, role, service, or device;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assigning the identifier to the intended individual, group, role, service, or device; and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Preventing reuse of identifiers for [at least two (2) years].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Common device identifiers include Media Access Control (MAC) addresses, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers. The management of individual identifiers is not applicable to shared system accounts. Typically, individual identifiers are the usernames of the system accounts assigned to those individuals. In such instances, the account management activities of &lt;a href=&#34;../ac-2/&#34;&gt;AC-2&lt;/a&gt; use account names provided by &lt;a href=&#34;../ia-4/&#34;&gt;IA-4&lt;/a&gt; . Identifier management also addresses individual identifiers not necessarily associated with system accounts. Preventing the reuse of identifiers implies preventing the assignment of previously used individual, group, role, service, or device identifiers to different individuals, groups, roles, services, or devices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Individuals conducting impact analyses possess the necessary skills and technical expertise to analyze the changes to systems as well as the security or privacy ramifications. Impact analyses include reviewing security and privacy plans, policies, and procedures to understand control requirements; reviewing system design documentation and operational procedures to understand control implementation and how specific system changes might affect the controls; reviewing the impact of changes on organizational supply chain partners with stakeholders; and determining how potential changes to a system create new risks to the privacy of individuals and the ability of implemented controls to mitigate those risks. Impact analyses also include risk assessments to understand the impact of the changes and determine if additional controls are required.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Configure the system to provide only [Assignment: organization-defined mission-essential capabilities for the system are defined;] ; and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prohibit or restrict the use of the following functions, ports, protocols, software, and/or services: [Assignment: organization-defined cm 7 prm 2].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Systems provide a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services routinely provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational missions, functions, or operations. Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single system component, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by that single component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single function per component. Organizations consider removing unused or unnecessary software and disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent unauthorized connection of components, transfer of information, and tunneling. Organizations employ network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protection technologies, such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems, to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, protocols, ports, and services. Least functionality can also be achieved as part of the fundamental design and development of the system (see &lt;a href=&#34;../sa-8/&#34;&gt;SA-8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;../sc-2/&#34;&gt;SC-2&lt;/a&gt; , and &lt;a href=&#34;../sc-3/&#34;&gt;SC-3&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Technical competence of supervising individuals relates to the maintenance performed on the systems, while having required access authorizations refers to maintenance on and near the systems. Individuals not previously identified as authorized maintenance personnel—such as information technology manufacturers, vendors, systems integrators, and consultants—may require privileged access to organizational systems, such as when they are required to conduct maintenance activities with little or no notice. Based on organizational assessments of risk, organizations may issue temporary credentials to these individuals. Temporary credentials may be for one-time use or for very limited time periods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Digital media includes flash drives, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external or removable hard disk drives (e.g., solid state, magnetic), compact discs, and digital versatile discs. Non-digital media includes paper and microfilm. Denying access to patient medical records in a community hospital unless the individuals seeking access to such records are authorized healthcare providers is an example of restricting access to non-digital media. Limiting access to the design specifications stored on compact discs in the media library to individuals on the system development team is an example of restricting access to digital media.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Examples include digital media in scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, workstations, network components, mobile devices, and non-digital media (e.g., paper and microfilm). The sanitization process removes information from system media such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques—including clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, de-identification of personally identifiable information, and destruction—prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals when such media is reused or released for disposal. Organizations determine the appropriate sanitization methods, recognizing that destruction is sometimes necessary when other methods cannot be applied to media requiring sanitization. Organizations use discretion on the employment of approved sanitization techniques and procedures for media that contains information deemed to be in the public domain or publicly releasable or information deemed to have no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if released for reuse or disposal. Sanitization of non-digital media includes destruction, removing a classified appendix from an otherwise unclassified document, or redacting selected sections or words from a document by obscuring the redacted sections or words in a manner equivalent in effectiveness to removing them from the document. NSA standards and policies control the sanitization process for media that contains classified information. NARA policies control the sanitization process for controlled unclassified information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Examples of physical access monitoring include the employment of guards, video surveillance equipment (i.e., cameras), and sensor devices. Reviewing physical access logs can help identify suspicious activity, anomalous events, or potential threats. The reviews can be supported by audit logging controls, such as &lt;a href=&#34;../au-2/&#34;&gt;AU-2&lt;/a&gt; , if the access logs are part of an automated system. Organizational incident response capabilities include investigations of physical security incidents and responses to the incidents. Incidents include security violations or suspicious physical access activities. Suspicious physical access activities include accesses outside of normal work hours, repeated accesses to areas not normally accessed, accesses for unusual lengths of time, and out-of-sequence accesses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Implement multi-factor authentication for access to non-privileged accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Multi-factor authentication requires the use of two or more different factors to achieve authentication. The authentication factors are defined as follows: something you know (e.g., a personal identification number [PIN]), something you have (e.g., a physical authenticator such as a cryptographic private key), or something you are (e.g., a biometric). Multi-factor authentication solutions that feature physical authenticators include hardware authenticators that provide time-based or challenge-response outputs and smart cards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card or the DoD Common Access Card. In addition to authenticating users at the system level, organizations may also employ authentication mechanisms at the application level, at their discretion, to provide increased information security. Regardless of the type of access (i.e., local, network, remote), non-privileged accounts are authenticated using multi-factor options appropriate for the level of risk. Organizations can provide additional security measures, such as additional or more rigorous authentication mechanisms, for specific types of access.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Local maintenance and diagnostic activities are carried out by individuals who are physically present at the system location and not communicating across a network connection. Authentication techniques used to establish nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions reflect the network access requirements in &lt;a href=&#34;../ia-2/&#34;&gt;IA-2&lt;/a&gt; . Strong authentication requires authenticators that are resistant to replay attacks and employ multi-factor authentication. Strong authenticators include PKI where certificates are stored on a token protected by a password, passphrase, or biometric. Enforcing requirements in &lt;a href=&#34;../ma-4/&#34;&gt;MA-4&lt;/a&gt; is accomplished, in part, by other controls. &lt;a href=&#34;#e59c5a7c-8b1f-49ca-8de0-6ee0882180ce&#34;&gt;SP 800-63B&lt;/a&gt; provides additional guidance on strong authentication and authenticators.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Penetration testing goes beyond automated vulnerability scanning and is conducted by agents and teams with demonstrable skills and experience that include technical expertise in network, operating system, and/or application level security. Penetration testing can be used to validate vulnerabilities or determine the degree of penetration resistance of systems to adversaries within specified constraints. Such constraints include time, resources, and skills. Penetration testing attempts to duplicate the actions of adversaries and provides a more in-depth analysis of security- and privacy-related weaknesses or deficiencies. Penetration testing is especially important when organizations are transitioning from older technologies to newer technologies (e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 network protocols).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Organizations may allow a limited number of user actions without identification or authentication, including when individuals access public websites or other publicly accessible federal systems, when individuals use mobile phones to receive calls, or when facsimiles are received. Organizations identify actions that normally require identification or authentication but may, under certain circumstances, allow identification or authentication mechanisms to be bypassed. Such bypasses may occur, for example, via a software-readable physical switch that commands bypass of the logon functionality and is protected from accidental or unmonitored use. Permitting actions without identification or authentication does not apply to situations where identification and authentication have already occurred and are not repeated but rather to situations where identification and authentication have not yet occurred. Organizations may decide that there are no user actions that can be performed on organizational systems without identification and authentication, and therefore, the value for the assignment operation can be &amp;ldquo;none.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Security topics at exit interviews include reminding individuals of nondisclosure agreements and potential limitations on future employment. Exit interviews may not always be possible for some individuals, including in cases related to the unavailability of supervisors, illnesses, or job abandonment. Exit interviews are important for individuals with security clearances. The timely execution of termination actions is essential for individuals who have been terminated for cause.

Proper position designation is the foundation of an effective and consistent suitability and personnel security program. The Position Designation System (PDS) assesses the duties and responsibilities of a position to determine the degree of potential damage to the efficiency or integrity of the service due to misconduct of an incumbent of a position and establishes the risk level of that position. The PDS assessment also determines if the duties and responsibilities of the position present the potential for position incumbents to bring about a material adverse effect on national security and the degree of that potential effect, which establishes the sensitivity level of a position. The results of the assessment determine what level of investigation is conducted for a position. Risk designations can guide and inform the types of authorizations that individuals receive when accessing organizational information and information systems. Position screening criteria include explicit information security role appointment requirements. Parts 1400 and 731 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, establish the requirements for organizations to evaluate relevant covered positions for a position sensitivity and position risk designation commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of those positions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maintain a separate execution domain for each executing system process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Systems can maintain separate execution domains for each executing process by assigning each process a separate address space. Each system process has a distinct address space so that communication between processes is performed in a manner controlled through the security functions, and one process cannot modify the executing code of another process. Maintaining separate execution domains for executing processes can be achieved, for example, by implementing separate address spaces. Process isolation technologies, including sandboxing or virtualization, logically separate software and firmware from other software, firmware, and data. Process isolation helps limit the access of potentially untrusted software to other system resources. The capability to maintain separate execution domains is available in commercial operating systems that employ multi-state processor technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Audit logging tools are those programs and devices used to conduct system audit and logging activities. Protection of audit information focuses on technical protection and limits the ability to access and execute audit logging tools to authorized individuals. Physical protection of audit information is addressed by both media protection controls and physical and environmental protection controls.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Protect the [Selection: confidentiality, integrity] of the following information at rest: [Assignment: organization-defined information at rest requiring protection is defined;].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is not in process or in transit and is located on system components. Such components include internal or external hard disk drives, storage area network devices, or databases. However, the focus of protecting information at rest is not on the type of storage device or frequency of access but rather on the state of the information. Information at rest addresses the confidentiality and integrity of information and covers user information and system information. System-related information that requires protection includes configurations or rule sets for firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, filtering routers, and authentication information. Organizations may employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, including the use of cryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning. Integrity protection can be achieved, for example, by implementing write-once-read-many (WORM) technologies. When adequate protection of information at rest cannot otherwise be achieved, organizations may employ other controls, including frequent scanning to identify malicious code at rest and secure offline storage in lieu of online storage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Publicly accessible content addresses systems that are controlled by the organization and accessible to the public, typically without identification or authentication. Posting information on non-organizational systems (e.g., non-organizational public websites, forums, and social media) is covered by organizational policy. While organizations may have individuals who are responsible for developing and implementing policies about the information that can be made publicly accessible, publicly accessible content addresses the management of the individuals who make such information publicly accessible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Establish and document usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and implementation guidance for each type of remote access allowed; and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Authorize each type of remote access to the system prior to allowing such connections.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remote access is access to organizational systems (or processes acting on behalf of users) that communicate through external networks such as the Internet. Types of remote access include dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations use encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity for remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs provides sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such connections as internal networks if the cryptographic mechanisms used are implemented in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does not enhance the availability of remote connections. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can also affect the ability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote access controls apply to systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public access. Authorization of each remote access type addresses authorization prior to allowing remote access without specifying the specific formats for such authorization. While organizations may use information exchange and system connection security agreements to manage remote access connections to other systems, such agreements are addressed as part of &lt;a href=&#34;../ca-3/&#34;&gt;CA-3&lt;/a&gt; . Enforcing access restrictions for remote access is addressed via &lt;a href=&#34;../ac-3/&#34;&gt;AC-3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Organization-defined actions include overwriting oldest audit records, shutting down the system, and stopping the generation of audit records. Organizations may choose to define additional actions for audit logging process failures based on the type of failure, the location of the failure, the severity of the failure, or a combination of such factors. When the audit logging process failure is related to storage, the response is carried out for the audit log storage repository (i.e., the distinct system component where the audit logs are stored), the system on which the audit logs reside, the total audit log storage capacity of the organization (i.e., all audit log storage repositories combined), or all three. Organizations may decide to take no additional actions after alerting designated roles or personnel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Respond to findings from security and privacy assessments, monitoring, and audits in accordance with organizational risk tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Organizations have many options for responding to risk including mitigating risk by implementing new controls or strengthening existing controls, accepting risk with appropriate justification or rationale, sharing or transferring risk, or avoiding risk. The risk tolerance of the organization influences risk response decisions and actions. Risk response addresses the need to determine an appropriate response to risk before generating a plan of action and milestones entry. For example, the response may be to accept risk or reject risk, or it may be possible to mitigate the risk immediately so that a plan of action and milestones entry is not needed. However, if the risk response is to mitigate the risk, and the mitigation cannot be completed immediately, a plan of action and milestones entry is generated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The integration of security and privacy considerations early in the system development life cycle is a foundational principle of systems security engineering and privacy engineering. To apply the required controls within the system development life cycle requires a basic understanding of information security and privacy, threats, vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risk to critical mission and business functions. The security engineering principles in &lt;a href=&#34;../sa-8/&#34;&gt;SA-8&lt;/a&gt; help individuals properly design, code, and test systems and system components. Organizations include qualified personnel (e.g., senior agency information security officers, senior agency officials for privacy, security and privacy architects, and security and privacy engineers) in system development life cycle processes to ensure that established security and privacy requirements are incorporated into organizational systems. Role-based security and privacy training programs can ensure that individuals with key security and privacy roles and responsibilities have the experience, skills, and expertise to conduct assigned system development life cycle activities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. Granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between system clocks and reference clocks (e.g., clocks synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or tens of milliseconds). Organizations may define different time granularities for different system components. Time service can be critical to other security capabilities such as access control and identification and authentication, depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support those capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
